# Lane Detection Project - Step by Step Learning

This project is a step-by-step implementation of a Lane Detection system for autonomous vehicles using Python and OpenCV.

## Current Progress
- [x] **Step 1: Environment Setup** - Installing libraries and verifying setup.
- [x] **Step 2: Image Loading & Preprocessing** - Grayscale and Blur.
- [x] **Step 3: Edge Detection** - Canny Algorithm.
- [x] **Step 4: Region of Interest** - Masking the road area.
- [x] **Step 5: Line Detection** - Hough Transform.
- [x] **Step 6: Optimization** - Averaging lines.
- [x] **Step 7: Video Pipeline** - Processing video frames.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`
